Being part of the [KCL Tech Society](http://kcltech.com) means there's always something useful happening. Our committee members make sure that our society is one of the the most active across the university. And I'm proud to say that I'm one of them.

[After the success of HackKing's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Wbo89GnxQ), I wished more first year students had come. However, because they were only first year students (as I was), it was understandable that many of them lacked the confidence to dive into such a massive event. And so I decided to set up an event for the first year students that would be a taster hackathon, and that would introduce them to the concept of hackathons.

And thus, the hackChallenge was born!

With the help of one of our lecturers Dr. Steffen Zschaler and third year Computer Science student Piotr Adam Galar, the first year representatives of the KCL Tech Society (Mark Ormesher, Mustafa Al-Bassam and I) were able to pull off one of the most exciting events the first year computer science class has ever had.

I didn’t expect so many students to come, but I was definitely wrong. I was able to convince over forty first year students to come to university for the whole of Saturday. That alone, to me, was an accomplishment.

The challenge was this: the students, in teams of three, had eight hours to program a smart automated trading system based on trading shares of projects that are available on the famous crowdfunding website Kickstarter. They had eight hours, from 11am to 7pm. At the end of the event, the teams would compete against each other by running their systems on the same Kickstarter projects. The teams that made the most profit at the end were the winners.

I have never seen the first year students so engaged and excited about programming before. They enjoyed the event and, most importantly, the atmosphere. They were really excited and active throughout the whole eight hours. They never gave up and always put a lot of effort into coding, knowing they didn't have to win but at least to accomplish something. They understood that it was all about the learning experience, more than the one of winning. And that's how they became winners.

The prizes were as follows:

- First Place: £30 Amazon gift card for each team member
- Second Place: £15 iTunes gift card for each team member
- Third Place: £10 Pizza Hut gift card for each team member

Having an influence on other people inspires me. I want make a difference in people's lives by helping them build their careers. Events like hackathons, they're replacing Career Fairs like nobody's business. And it's time we introduced it to the world.

This Monday [I'm giving a talk](https://www.facebook.com/events/429304987173203/) on how startups, hackathons and programming is changing the world and the way people look at the tech industry. I hope it goes well, and I hope I see you there!
