[I gave a talk](https://www.facebook.com/events/429304987173203/) on how startups, hackathons and programming are changing the world and the way people look at the tech industry. One of the things I focused most on was the importance of programming.

So, how do you get started with programming?

First thing's first: establish a goal in mind. Do you want to make your own personal website? Do you want to make an app? Do you want to build a robot?

The best place to first look at is [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/) because it assumes 0 knowledge on all of its courses. They're also pretty interactive and fun to learn.

When it comes to "what languages are best to start with", it really depends on what you intend to do. 

##Do you want to make apps? 
- The [TheNewBoston.org's Java courses](http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=31) are great. Use that to learn Java if you want to make Android apps.
- Stanford University put up their iPhone & iPad App Development courses [online for free on iTunes U](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550). It assumes a little prior programming knowledge.
- A really, really easy language to learn is VB.NET, and you can use it to develop websites and Windows Phone apps. [HomeAndLearn](http://homeandlearn.co.uk/NET/vbNet.html) have a really smooth teaching site.

##Do you want to build websites? (all of these languages can be done in Codecademy)
- The one to rule them all: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which are three very easy and awesome languages. Combined, you can make pretty epic websites too that work on both desktop and mobile. However, you can do more with other languages that may be difficult to do with JavaScript. Note: HTML and CSS are scripting languages, used to format and style a page, and unlike JavaScript, they are not considered programming languages.
- Ruby is currently one of the easiest and most effective web languages there are, but [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a framework you'll have to learn too. It's not that difficult, it's pretty easy once you've done the Ruby course on Codecademy and their documentation is pretty awesome.
- PHP is the most common language used for websites that I've seen. Not extremely easy to learn, but pretty useful to nevertheless.
- Python is a good back-end manager for websites too. And it's an extremely easy language to learn, and you can do so much with Python its insane. If you buy a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs), it teaches you how to program. [Mark Ormesher](http://markormesher.co.uk), a friend of mine, built a robot car using Python, Java and a Raspberry Pi!


The good news is, once you've learned a language like PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C even VB.NET, every other language becomes a tenth as difficult to learn. The difficult things to learn are the different processes of thinking and of logic used, things like conditionals or loops. For example, a conditional is a statement that depends on a truth value, like:

<div class="message">if (isSnowing)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classesAreCancelled = true <br>else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classesAreCancelled = false</div>

A loop is similar, except that it's like asking keep asking "Is it snowing? Is it still snowing? Is it still snowing? Is it still snowing?" until it finds out that it's not longer snowing, so it exits the loop.

<div class="message">while (isSnowing)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classesAreCancelled = true</div>

There you go, that's two of the "difficult" things to understand in programming.
